# Webhook Delivery

How NullSpend delivers webhook events, including transport, retries, and failure handling.

## Two Delivery Paths

NullSpend has two independent systems that dispatch webhooks, depending on where the event originates:

| Path | Events | Transport | Retries |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Proxy-side** | `cost_event.created`, all budget events, `velocity.*`, `session.*`, `tag_budget.*`, `request.blocked` | QStash | 5 retries, exponential backoff |
| **Dashboard-side** | `action.*`, `test.ping`, dashboard-originated `cost_event.created` | Direct HTTP POST | None (fire-and-forget) |

Both paths sign payloads identically — your verification code works the same regardless of which path delivered the event.

## Proxy-Side Delivery

Events from the proxy worker are delivered via [QStash](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash), Upstash's managed message queue.

**How it works:**

1. The proxy builds the event payload and signs it with your endpoint's signing secret
2. The signed event is published to QStash with your endpoint URL as the destination
3. QStash delivers the HTTP POST to your endpoint
4. If your endpoint returns a non-2xx response or doesn't respond within 5 seconds, QStash retries

**Retry behavior:**

- **5 retry attempts** with exponential backoff
- Your endpoint must return a **2xx** status code within **5 seconds**
- After all retries are exhausted, the event goes to QStash's dead-letter queue (DLQ)

**Event type filtering:** Each endpoint can subscribe to specific event types. If an endpoint's `eventTypes` array is empty, it receives all events. If it lists specific types, only matching events are dispatched.

## Dashboard-Side Delivery

Events from the Next.js dashboard (action lifecycle events, test pings) are delivered directly via HTTP POST.

**How it works:**

1. The dashboard queries the database for your active webhook endpoints
2. Each matching endpoint receives a signed HTTP POST
3. The request has a **5-second timeout** — if your endpoint doesn't respond in time, the attempt is abandoned
4. **No retries.** Dashboard-side delivery is fire-and-forget.

**Secret rotation cleanup:** After dispatching, the dashboard checks for endpoints with expired rotation windows (older than 24 hours) and clears the previous signing secret. This cleanup is lazy and fire-and-forget — it doesn't affect delivery.

## Headers

Every webhook POST — from both paths — includes these headers:

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Always JSON |
| `X-NullSpend-Signature` | HMAC-SHA256 signature | Verify authenticity (see [Security](security.md)) |
| `X-NullSpend-Webhook-Id` | Event ID (e.g., `evt_a1b2c3d4-...`) | Deduplicate deliveries |
| `X-NullSpend-Webhook-Timestamp` | Unix timestamp (seconds) | Detect replay attacks |
| `User-Agent` | `NullSpend-Webhooks/1.0` | Identify NullSpend traffic |

## Payload Modes

Endpoints can be configured with a payload mode that controls how `cost_event.created` events are delivered:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **full** (default) | Complete event data in `data.object` |
| **thin** | Reference only in `related_object` — fetch full data from the API |

Payload mode only affects `cost_event.created` events. All other event types always use full payloads regardless of the endpoint's mode setting.

**Thin payload example:**

```json
{
  "id": "evt_a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "type": "cost_event.created",
  "api_version": "2026-04-01",
  "created_at": 1711036800,
  "related_object": {
    "id": "req_xyz",
    "type": "cost_event",
    "url": "/api/cost-events?requestId=req_xyz&provider=openai"
  }
}
```

Fetch the full event data using the `url` field with your API key. See [Webhooks Overview](overview.md) for more on payload modes.

## Failure Handling

Webhook delivery is **fail-open** — errors are logged but never block the operation that triggered the event.

- A failed webhook dispatch never prevents a cost event from being written
- A failed webhook dispatch never blocks or delays an API response
- If the endpoint lookup fails (cache miss + DB error), the event is silently dropped

**QStash DLQ:** On the proxy side, events that fail all 5 retry attempts land in QStash's dead-letter queue. These are not automatically retried — check QStash's dashboard for failed deliveries.

**Dashboard side:** No DLQ. Failed deliveries are logged server-side but not retried or stored.

## Endpoint Caching

### Proxy

The proxy caches endpoint metadata (ID, URL, event types) to avoid querying the database on every request:

- **Workers KV** with a **5-minute TTL** (preferred when the KV binding is available)
- **Redis** with a 5-minute TTL (fallback)
- **Signing secrets are never cached** — they are always fetched from the database at dispatch time

Cache invalidation happens when you create, update, or delete an endpoint via the dashboard API.

### Dashboard

The dashboard queries the database directly for each dispatch — no caching layer.

## Best Practices

- **Return 200 fast.** Do your processing asynchronously. Proxy-side events retry on timeout; dashboard-side events are lost.
- **Deduplicate by event ID.** Use the `X-NullSpend-Webhook-Id` header (same as `event.id`) to skip duplicate deliveries from retries.
- **Don't rely on ordering.** Events may arrive out of order, especially with retries. Use `created_at` to determine sequence.
- **Use thin mode for high volume.** If you process hundreds of cost events per minute, thin mode reduces bandwidth and latency. Fetch full details on demand.
- **Monitor for DLQ entries.** If your endpoint has persistent failures, events accumulate in QStash's DLQ. Check it periodically.
