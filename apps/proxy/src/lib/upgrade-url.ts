/**
 * Resolve the upgrade URL for a denial response.
 *
 * Priority order (for customer denials):
 *   1. customer-level URL (customer_mappings.upgrade_url)
 *   2. org-level URL (organizations.metadata.upgradeUrl)
 *   3. null (no upgrade_url field in the response)
 *
 * For non-customer denials (generic budget_exceeded where the denying
 * entity is user/api_key/default/org), only the org-level URL is used.
 *
 * The caller is responsible for determining whether the denial code
 * warrants an upgrade URL at all — this helper is agnostic to denial
 * type. Per decision 5 of the plan, only `budget_exceeded` and
 * `customer_budget_exceeded` should call this helper.
 *
 * `{customer_id}` placeholder substitution: if the resolved URL contains
 * the literal string `{customer_id}`, it is replaced with the actual
 * customer ID (URL-encoded). If no customer ID is in scope, the
 * placeholder is left untouched — the caller gets a URL that a dev
 * viewing the raw response can fix, rather than a silently-null field.
 *
 * @param orgUrl        org.metadata.upgradeUrl, or null
 * @param customerUrl   customer_mappings.upgrade_url, or null
 * @param customerId    current request's customer ID, or null/undefined
 * @returns             resolved URL string, or null if neither URL is set
