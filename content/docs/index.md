FinOps layer for AI agents — cost tracking, budget enforcement, and human-in-the-loop approval.

## The Problem

AI agents call LLMs autonomously. Without guardrails, a single runaway loop can burn through thousands of dollars before anyone notices. Existing observability tools can _alert_ you after the damage is done. NullSpend **prevents** it.

## How It Works

```
Your App ──► NullSpend Proxy ──► OpenAI / Anthropic
                │                       │
                │  ◄── streams back ────┘
                │
                ▼
         Dashboard & Webhooks
```

Two config changes. No SDK. No code rewrite.

```bash
# Before                                    # After
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1   OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://proxy.nullspend.com/v1
```

Add an `X-NullSpend-Key` header and every request is tracked, budgeted, and visible.

## Features

| Feature | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **[Cost tracking](features/cost-tracking.md)** | Per-request cost calculation for every model — input, output, cached, and reasoning tokens |
| **[Budget enforcement](features/budgets.md)** | Hard spending ceilings. The proxy returns `429` before the request reaches the provider |
| **[Velocity limits](features/budgets.md#velocity-limits)** | Detect runaway loops — block when spend rate exceeds a threshold within a time window |
| **[Session limits](features/budgets.md#session-limits)** | Per-conversation spend caps tied to a session ID |
| **[Tags](features/tags.md)** | Attribute costs to teams, environments, features, or anything else via `X-NullSpend-Tags` |
| **[Tracing](features/tracing.md)** | W3C `traceparent` propagation and custom trace IDs for request correlation |
| **[Webhooks](webhooks/overview.md)** | 15 event types with HMAC-SHA256 signing — cost events, budget exceeded, velocity alerts, threshold crossings |
| **[HITL approvals](features/human-in-the-loop.md)** | Human-in-the-loop approval workflow for high-cost or sensitive operations |
| **[Organizations](features/organizations.md)** | Team collaboration with roles (owner, admin, member, viewer), per-org billing, and invitation management |
| **[Request logging](features/cost-tracking.md#request--response-body-logging)** | Opt-in capture of full request/response bodies (including streaming) for debugging and audit (Pro/Enterprise) |
| **[Session replay](features/cost-tracking.md#session-replay)** | Group LLM calls by session ID, view the full chronological timeline, expand to see request/response bodies |
| **Multi-provider** | OpenAI and Anthropic in a single dashboard with provider breakdown |
| **MCP support** | Budget enforcement for Model Context Protocol servers and proxies |

## Trust Model

The proxy never modifies your requests or responses. Your provider API keys stay with you — they pass through to the upstream provider and are never stored. By default, NullSpend sees only the token counts in the response to calculate cost — prompt content is not logged. Pro and Enterprise plans can opt in to **request/response body logging** for debugging and audit purposes; bodies are stored encrypted in R2 with per-org lifecycle policies.

## SDKs

Client libraries and adapters for integrating NullSpend into your stack:

- [JavaScript SDK](sdks/javascript.md) — `@nullspend/sdk` — TypeScript/JavaScript client for the NullSpend API
- [Claude Agent Adapter](sdks/claude-agent.md) — `@nullspend/claude-agent` — routes Claude Agent SDK calls through the proxy
